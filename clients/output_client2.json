It provides a hierarchical structure that allows users to access and manage files efficiently. Key components include:\\n\\n* **Directories:** Folders that organize files into a tree-like structure.\\n* **Files:** Units of data stored within the file system.\\n* **Metadata:** Information about files, such as name, size, creation date, and permissions.\\n* **File system operations:**  Actions like creating, deleting, copying, moving, and accessing files.\\n\\nFile systems can be organized in different ways, but common features include:\\n\\n* **Hierarchical structure:**  Files are arranged within directories, which can contain subdirectories.\\n* **Naming conventions:**  Files and directories have unique names to identify them.\\n* **Permissions:** Control access to files and directories, defining who can read, write, or execute them.\\n* **Metadata:**  Information about files like creation dates, sizes, and ownership helps manage and locate files.\", \"example\": \"Think of a library. Each book is like a file, and the shelves are like directories. The librarian assigns each book a unique ID (like a file name) and keeps track of its details (metadata). You can browse the shelves (directories) to find the book (file) you're looking for. The library has rules about who can borrow books (permissions).\"}\n"
