        "{\"title\": \"How Computer Networks Work\", \"content\": \"Computer networks are a fundamental part of our modern world, connecting billions of devices and enabling communication, information sharing, and access to vast resources. Here's a breakdown of how they work:\\n\\n**1. Network Components:**\\n\\n* **Devices:** Computers, smartphones, servers, printers, and other devices that need to communicate.\\n* **Network Interface Cards (NICs):** Physical components within devices that allow them to connect to the network.\\n* **Network Media:** Cables (copper or fiber optic) or wireless signals that carry data between devices.\\n* **Network Hubs/Switches/Routers:** Devices that manage network traffic and connect different network segments.\\n\\n**2. Network Protocols:**\\n\\n* **Protocols:** Sets of rules that govern how data is transmitted and received across the network. Common protocols include:\\n    * **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):** The foundation of the internet, defining how data is packaged, addressed, and routed.\\n    * **Ethernet:** A standard for connecting devices on a local area network (LAN).\\n    * **Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity):** A standard for wireless networking.\\n\\n**3. Data Transmission:**\\n\\n* **Data Packets:** Data is divided into small units called packets. Each packet contains information about its destination, source, and the data itself.\\n* **Addressing:**  Each device on a network has a unique address (IP address) that identifies it. Packets are addressed to specific devices.\\n* **Routing:** Routers examine packet addresses and forward them along the best path to reach their destination.\\n\\n**4. Network Topologies:**\\n\\n* **Bus Topology:** All devices are connected to a single cable. Simple but vulnerable to failures.\\n* **Star Topology:** All devices connect to a central hub or switch. More robust but requires a central point of failure.\\n* **Ring Topology:** Devices are connected in a closed loop. Reliable but difficult to manage.\\n\\n**5. Network Types:**\\n\\n* **Local Area Network (LAN):** Connects devices within a limited area, such as a home or office.\\n* **Wide Area Network (WAN):** Connects devices over long distances, often using public networks like the internet.\\n* **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):** Covers a city or metropolitan area.\\n\\n**6. Network Security:**\\n\\n* **Firewalls:** Protect networks from unauthorized access by filtering network traffic.\\n* **Antivirus Software:** Prevents malware from infecting devices and networks.\\n* **Encryption:** Scrambles data to make it unreadable without the correct decryption key.\\n\\n**7. Internet:**\\n\\n* **The internet is a global network of interconnected networks. It uses a hierarchical structure of routers and networks to connect devices worldwide.\\n* **Domain Name System (DNS):** Translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses that computers can understand.\\n\\n**In essence, computer networks allow devices to communicate with each other by dividing data into packets, addressing them, and routing them through network infrastructure using established protocols.**\", \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Network_Diagram_with_Devices.svg/1280px-Network_Diagram_with_Devices.svg.png\"}\n"
